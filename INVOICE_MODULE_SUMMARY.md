## 🎯 Integration Guide

### Basic Integration
```tsx
import InvoiceModule from './components/invoice/InvoiceModule';
import { InvoiceProvider } from './contexts/InvoiceContext';

function App() {
  return (
    <InvoiceProvider>
      <InvoiceModule />
    </InvoiceProvider>
  );
}
```

### Dashboard Integration
```tsx
import InvoiceDashboard from './components/invoice/InvoiceDashboard';
import { InvoiceProvider } from './contexts/InvoiceContext';

function Dashboard() {
  return (
    <InvoiceProvider>
      <InvoiceDashboard />
    </InvoiceProvider>
  );
}
```
