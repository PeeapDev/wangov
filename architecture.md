- Secret management with Vault
- Security scanning and monitoring
- Identity and access management

### DevOps Infrastructure
- CI/CD pipelines for each container
- Automated testing frameworks
- Environment management
- Configuration management
- Deployment orchestration

## Integration Architecture

### Internal Communication
- RESTful APIs for synchronous operations
- Message queues for asynchronous operations
- Event-driven architecture for real-time updates
- Service mesh for service discovery and security

### External Integration
- API gateway for all external access
- Developer SDKs for common platforms
- Webhooks for event notifications
- Batch processing interfaces
- Mobile app integration points

## Deployment Model

### Development Environment
- Docker Compose for local development
- Individual service development with hot reloading
- Mock services for dependencies
- Local development databases

### Testing Environment
- Kubernetes cluster for integration testing
- Automated testing pipeline
- Performance testing environment
- Security testing tools

### Production Environment
- High-availability Kubernetes cluster
- Multi-zone deployment
- Auto-scaling configurations
- Blue/green deployment strategy
- Disaster recovery capabilities

## Scaling Strategy

### Vertical Scaling
- Resource allocation based on service demands
- Database read replicas for high-traffic periods
- Memory optimization for critical services

### Horizontal Scaling
- Stateless services for easy replication
- Sticky sessions where needed
- Distributed caching
- Load balancing across service instances

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (3-6 months)
- Deploy WanGov-ID container
- Implement core identity and authentication
- Set up basic API gateway
- Establish development infrastructure

### Phase 2: Initial Services (6-9 months)
- Deploy WanGov-Tax container
- Build WanGov-Dashboard for administration
- Enhance API gateway capabilities
- Implement monitoring and logging

### Phase 3: Expanded Services (9-18 months)
- Deploy WanGov-Registry container
- Deploy WanGov-Health container
- Enhance integration capabilities
- Improve security and compliance features

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (18+ months)
- Implement advanced analytics
- Develop mobile applications
- Add specialized services based on demand
- Optimize performance and user experience

## Technology Stack

### Backend Services
- Node.js/TypeScript for API services
- Python for data processing services
- Java for integration with legacy systems
- Go for high-performance services

### Databases
- PostgreSQL for relational data
- MongoDB for document storage
- Redis for caching and sessions
- Elasticsearch for search capabilities

### Frontend

- Certificate-based service authentication
- Token validation and refresh policies
- Biometric verification security

### Data Security
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Data masking for sensitive information
- Audit logging of all data access
- Role-based access controls

### Compliance Requirements
- Sierra Leone data protection laws
- International security standards (ISO 27001)
- Privacy by design principles
- Regular security assessments

## Disaster Recovery

### Backup Strategy
- Regular automated backups

## Future Extensibility

The containerized architecture allows for future extension to additional government services, including:

- Education services
- Agriculture support systems
- Social welfare programs
- Infrastructure management
- Public safety and emergency services
- Environmental monitoring
- Tourism and cultural heritage

Each new service can be deployed as an additional container with its own development lifecycle while integrating with the core identity system.
