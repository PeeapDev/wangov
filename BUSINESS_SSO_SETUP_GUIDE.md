# WanGov Business SSO Setup Guide

## Overview

WanGov now provides **business-specific SSO** similar to Google Cloud Console, where each registered business can have its own SSO configuration and credentials.

## Architecture

### 1. **Business Registration** (Required First Step)
- Businesses must be registered and **approved** in the WanGov Organization Portal
- Only approved businesses can enable SSO
- Location: Organization Portal â†’ Business Registration

### 2. **SSO Management** (New Dedicated Section)
- **Separate from API Integration** (API Keys are for data exchange)
- **Business-specific configurations** (each business gets unique credentials)
- Location: Organization Portal â†’ SSO Management

### 3. **WordPress Plugin** (Simplified Configuration)
- Only requires: **Client ID** + **Client Secret**
- No hardcoded URLs or complex configuration
- Works with any business's SSO credentials

## Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Register Your Business
1. Go to **Organization Portal â†’ Business Registration**
2. Register your business with complete details
3. Wait for **approval** (required for SSO)

### Step 2: Enable SSO for Your Business
1. Go to **Organization Portal â†’ SSO Management**
2. Find your **approved business** in the list
3. Click **"Enable SSO"**
4. Enter your **Authorized Redirect URIs**:
   ```
   https://yoursite.com/wangov-auth/callback
   https://app.yoursite.com/auth/callback
   ```
5. Click **"Enable SSO"**
6. **Copy your Client ID and Client Secret**

### Step 3: Configure WordPress Plugin
1. Install the **WanGov ID WordPress Plugin**
2. Go to **WordPress Admin â†’ Settings â†’ WanGov ID**
3. Enter your business-specific credentials:
   - **Client ID**: `wangov_yourbusiness_abc123def456`
   - **Client Secret**: `sk_live_yourbusiness_xyz789abc123`
4. **Enable** the integration
5. **Save Changes**

### Step 4: Test SSO

## Migration from Old System

If you were using the old universal client system:

1. **Register your business** (if not already done)
2. **Enable SSO** for your specific business
3. **Update WordPress plugin** with new business-specific credentials
4. **Test the integration**

The old universal client will be deprecated in favor of business-specific SSO.

## Support

For issues with:
- **Business Registration**: Contact organization support
- **SSO Configuration**: Check SSO Management dashboard
- **WordPress Plugin**: Review plugin settings and logs
- **Authentication Issues**: Check SSO server debug logs

## Next Steps

1. **Complete business registration and approval**
2. **Enable SSO for your business**
3. **Configure WordPress plugin with business credentials**
4. **Test and deploy SSO integration**

This new system provides enterprise-grade SSO management similar to major OAuth providers while maintaining the simplicity of the WanGov ecosystem.
